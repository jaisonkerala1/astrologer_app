## ✅ Expected Behavior

### **Successful Integration:**
- ✅ No crashes or runtime errors
- ✅ Calendar loads smoothly
- ✅ Consultations display correctly
- ✅ Date changes work instantly
- ✅ Loading states show appropriately
- ✅ Error messages are clear
- ✅ State updates are reactive (BlocBuilder rebuilds)

### **BLoC Integration Signs:**
- ✅ App starts without errors (DI successful)
- ✅ CalendarBloc registered in service locator
- ✅ CalendarBloc provided in app.dart
- ✅ No conflicts with existing BLoCs

---

## 🐛 What to Look For (Potential Issues)

### **Common Integration Issues:**
- ❌ Calendar screen crashes on open → Check BLoC initialization
- ❌ Data doesn't load → Check repository API calls
- ❌ State doesn't update → Check BlocBuilder connections
- ❌ App crashes on startup → Check service locator registration
- ❌ Consultations show wrong date → Check date filtering logic

### **Known Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Backend API endpoints may not exist yet (will show errors)
- ⚠️ Some calendar features might use old CalendarService
- ⚠️ UI might not be fully connected to new BLoC yet

```

**On Calendar Operations:**
- API call logs
- State transition logs
- Error logs (if any)

---

## 🚨 If Issues Found

1. **Note the exact steps to reproduce**
2. **Check console for error messages**
3. **Take screenshots if UI issues**
4. **Test if other features still work**
5. **Report back with details**
