## 🎯 Phase 2 Recommendations

Based on this review, Phase 2 should focus on:

1. **Add Equatable to States** (High Priority)
   - AuthState classes
   - DashboardState classes
   - ConsultationsState classes
   - ProfileState classes

2. **Consolidate State Classes** (Medium Priority)
   - ProfileBloc: Merge LoadedState and UpdatedState
   - DashboardBloc: Merge StatusUpdatedState into LoadedState
   - Use status flags instead of multiple classes

3. **Implement copyWith** (Medium Priority)
   - All state classes need copyWith
   - Prevents data loss during loading

4. **Complete Caching** (Low Priority)
   - Implement toJson/fromJson for models
   - Complete cache implementations (currently placeholders)
