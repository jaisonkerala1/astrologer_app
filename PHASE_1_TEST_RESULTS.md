## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Auth Middleware Import
**Problem:** Routes imported `verifyToken` but auth.js exports `auth`  
**Fix:** Changed all `verifyToken` → `auth` in discussion routes  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue 2: User ID Reference
**Problem:** Controller used `req.user.id` but middleware sets `req.user.astrologerId`  
**Fix:** Changed all `req.user.id` → `req.user.astrologerId`  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue 3: Package Lock Sync
**Problem:** socket.io added to package.json but package-lock.json not updated  
**Fix:** Ran `npm install` and committed updated package-lock.json  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

## 🚀 Ready for Phase 2

### What's Working:

✅ Real-time Socket.IO server active  
✅ Database models with proper relationships  
✅ Nested comments (1-level Instagram style)  
✅ Like, save, subscribe features

✅ Server deployed on Railway  

### Next Steps (Phase 2):

   - Add Socket.IO client integration
   - Implement offline mode with sync queue

2. **Update UI Layer**
   - Connect discussion_screen.dart to API
   - Connect discussion_detail_screen.dart to API
   - Add real-time listeners for Socket.IO events

3. **Data Migration**
   - Optional: Migrate local data to server
   - Keep SharedPreferences as cache layer

4. **Testing**
   - Test all features in Flutter app
   - Verify real-time updates work
   - Test offline mode
